NoteToPrompt is a lightweight, client-side utility designed for Prompt Engineers. It fixes the common issue where pasting formatted notes into ChatGPT or Claude results in lost indentation and broken hierarchy.

## 🚀 Why Use This?
- **Preserve Hierarchy:** Keeps nested bullets and sub-points intact.
- **Reduce Token Count:** Strips hidden HTML junk that wastes your context window.
- **Improved AI Reasoning:** Markdown is the native language of LLMs.

## 🔒 Privacy
All conversion happens locally in your browser. Your notes are never sent to a server.
